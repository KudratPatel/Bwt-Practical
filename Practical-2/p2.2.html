    <h2><font color="red">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically 
        carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern 
        digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as 
        programs, which enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term 
        computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the
         hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used 
         for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function 
         together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</h2>
    <h3><center><font color="red">A broad range of industrial and consumer products use 
        computers as control systems, including simple special-purpose devices like 
        microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. 
        Computers are at the core of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and 
        mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links 
        billions of computers and users.</center></h3>
        <pr><font color="red">Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one 
            processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a 
            microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically 
            semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and 
            logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of 
            operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input 
            devices (keyboards, mice, joysticks, etc.), output devices (monitors, printers, 
            etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g. touchscreens). 
            Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, 
            and they enable the results of operations to be saved and retrieved.</pr>
