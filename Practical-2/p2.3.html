    <h2>Types Of Network Topology.</h2>
    <h3><i>The main types of network topology include Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree, and Hybrid topologies,
         along with Point-to-Point and Daisy Chain.<u>These describe the physical or logical arrangement of
             devices in a network, each with unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages that influence
              connectivity, performance, and reliability.</u></i></h3>
    <h2><br><b>Point to Piont Topology.</b></h2>
    <h3>A point-to-point topology creates a direct, dedicated communication link between two devices,
        such as two computers or a home and office, reserving the entire bandwidth of the link for their
         exclusive use. This provides high speed and efficiency, but its simplicity makes it unsuitable
        for larger networks as it lacks redundancy and requires a new connection for each additional device.
         Examples include <del>phone calls,</del><ins>satellite links,</ins> and dedicated leased lines connecting geographically
        distant locations.</h3>
        <p><b>Mesh Topology</b></p>
        <h3>Mesh topology is a network configuration where devices are interconnected, creating multiple,
             redundant paths for data to travel between nodes. Each device (node) connects to several other
             devices, forming a decentralized, web-like structure. This architecture offers high fault tolerance
             and redundancy, as data can be re-routed if a single connection or node fails, ensuring continuous
             network operation. There are two main types: full mesh, where every node is connected to every other
             node, and partial mesh, where only some nodes have multiple connections.Then The Total Number Of dedicated
            links required to connect them is <sup>N</sup>C <sub>2</sub> i.e<mark> N(N-1)/2.</mark></h3>
            <p>Advantages Of Mesh Topology.</p>
            <p>The main advantages of mesh topology are its extreme reliability and fault tolerance due to
                multiple paths for data and no central point of failure, making it robust and able to continue
                operating even if a node or link fails. Other benefits include enhanced security and privacy with
                direct, non-broadcast communication, improved performance through efficient data routing, and
                easy scalability for adding new devices without network disruption. </p>
